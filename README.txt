This is a 0 click solution to ripping DVD's, simply insert a DVD into your DVD drive and the program will rip automatically . 

It also collects the meta data for you!!


It takes a few inital steps to setup but after that the program works like a charm

// UPDATES 
v.2
- Now renames folder based on movie title, IE; Bernie (2012) , Wet Hot American Summer (2001)
- Minor bug fixes
- 
//Notes & to do
- Does not handle subtitles yet

- Messed up on Monsters inc for some reason, possibly the comma? 
It created two folders, Monsters and Inc and created a file called Monsters, without the .mp4 extension and put it in the Rips directly as opposed to inside a Monsters Inc folder

- Please feel free to offer suggestions etc, this is my first program ever, I am completely self taught.
